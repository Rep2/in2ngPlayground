A small angularJS-based playground repo used for the AngularJS training track.

## What now?

### Git setup

If you are on the AngularJS track in IN2, clone this repository. You can do this by installing git. Then, create a github account if you already do not have one, and notify us of its creation by emailing your username to [us](luka.skukan@in2.hr).

Set up the basics of your git account - your username, password and proxy settings.

```bash
git config --global user.name your_name
git config --global user.email your_email
git config --global http.proxy proxy.in2.hr:8080
git config --global https.proxy proxy.in2.hr:8080
```

Once everything is set up, clone this repository by doing the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tweety-FER/in2ngPlayground.git
```

You now have this repository in the directory **in2ngPlayground**

### Git updates

When you are done with your updates, you have to **add**, **commit** and **push** your changes. Adding changes is a means of notifying git that those files have changes. You can simply navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following, if you wish to add everything.

```bash
git add .
```
